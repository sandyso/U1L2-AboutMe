      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I'm an energetic and enthusiastic person that's also mild-mannered and observant. I'm an eclectic indivdual with a lot of interests. I also like learning and mastering new things.</p>
      <p>It's important to me to always be open to try new things. Whether it's a new skill, a new routine, or even a new kind of food, I always want to be open to learning and experiencing more.</p>

      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born in California. However, my family and I have traveled since then. I've lived in New Mexico, Texas, and now New York. My love of traveling probably stems from this.</p>

      <h1>More About Me</h1>
      <h2>What are your favorite hobbies?</h2>
      <p>I love watching movies. I'm definitely a movie enthusiast. I don't know that I have a favorite genre because I love to watch action, science fiction/fantasy, drama, independant films, etc. I also like to make GIFs of the different movies and tv shows
        I've watched. I learned once, while I was interning for a digital magazine, and have had fun doing it ever since. Outside of the house, I love to go bowling, swimming, bike-riding, and dancing. Though, more often than not, I find myself surfing the
      internet at home on my days off.</p>
      <h2>What's your dream job?</h2>
      <p>My dream job is to be a public relations manager for an entertainment company.</p>
      <h2>What music have you been listening to lately?</h2>
      <p>I listen to a lot of different genres of music. Mostly, I like to listen to alternative rock, but lately, I find myself listening to today's hits.</p>
